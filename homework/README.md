This directory simulates running optavc, but I didn't run it on a cluster so it failed.
Write a bash function that when exectued in the GRAD directory prints the displacement number
(or the number of the directory) that has failed. HINT: search the file in some way (grep)

When psi4 exits it either prints:

`*** Psi4 encountered an error. Buy a developer more coffee!`
or

`*** Psi4 exiting successfully. Buy a developer a beer!`
